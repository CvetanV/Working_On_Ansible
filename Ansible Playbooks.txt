# Install NGNIX

1. sudo nano nginx-install.yml
Paste the code bellow:
---
- name: set up ngnix webserver
  hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: ensure nginx is at the latest version
    apt:
      name: nginx
      state: latest
    vars:
      use_backend: apt

  - name: start nginx
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: started
      enabled: yes  # if you want to also enable nginx

2. in the directory where you saved the nginx.install.yml file do:
- ansible-playbook -i /etc/ansible/hosts nginx-install.yml --check #Checks if the tasks will be executed or there are errors
- ansible-playbook -i /etc/ansible/hosts nginx-install.yml #Runs the playbook and deploys the service on the hosts listed in the file /etc/ansible/hosts

3. To stop the nginx service change the nginx-install.yml file to:
---
- name: set up ngnix webserver
  hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: ensure nginx is at the latest version
    apt:
      name: nginx
      state: latest
    vars:
      use_backend: apt

  - name: start nginx
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: stopped
      enabled: yes  # if you want to also enable nginx
